# rq-dashboard-ios
This is an interface for [RQ-Dashboard](https://github.com/nvie/rq-dashboard) for iOS. With this app you can manage your queues, look at the state of your workers, without ever touching your browser.

## Why?
First of, why not? But I got tired of continuously checking the webinterface on my phone, and wanted something simpeler. Also, I wanted an oppertunity for building my first real objective-c app :)

## Compatibility
The current release is compatible with version rq-dashboard v0.3.3

## Building
This projects uses CocoaPods, please make sure you have CocoaPods installed. After that, initialize the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

	$ pod install

And you should be good to go. Be sure to always use the `rq-dashboard.xcworkspace` file instead of the `.xcodeproj` file.
